            <li>Prepare the macaroni following the instructions on the package (boil for 7-8 minutes, or until it is soft). Drain the macaroni using a colander.</li><BR>
            <li>Add the butter, flour, and onion powder to a medium saucepan. Whisk the ingredients together and warm over medium heat until the butter melts and the mixture starts to bubble. After it starts bubbling, keep whisking and cook for one additional minute.</li><BR>
            <li>Once you’ve prepared the roux with butter and flour, gradually whisk in the milk. Keep cooking and whisking over medium heat until the milk starts to simmer gently, at which point it will reach the thickness of heavy cream or gravy.</li><BR>
            <li>Switch off the burner. Add salt and hot sauce to the white sauce for seasoning.</li><BR>
            <li>Start by incorporating the shredded cheddar, adding it a handful at a time, while whisking until it has fully melted before introducing additional cheese. Keep this process going until every bit of cheese is integrated into the sauce. If the sauce cools down too much to melt the cheese, you can return it to low heat for a short time to assist in melting the cheese. Be cautious not to overheat the sauce, as this can cause it to separate and develop a grainy texture.</li><BR>
            <li>Incorporate the cooked and drained pasta into the pot with the cheese sauce and mix well. Serve while hot and relish the flavors!</li><BR>
