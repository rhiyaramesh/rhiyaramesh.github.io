Hello! I am a 7th-grade student and the team leader of this project. I have developed a strong interest in Information Technology and Computer Science, and I am excited to pursue a career in this field. In addition to TSA, I am actively involved in extracurricular activities such as piano, tennis, Indian classical music, and Model United Nations. I also serve as the co-president of the Scratch Coding Club, where I have expanded my knowledge of coding and other IT topics. Through this project, I have learned to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I look forward to deepening my understanding of Computer Science and IT.
