            <li>Using a sharp paring knife, extract the seeds from the vanilla bean. Place both the seeds and the pods into a medium-sized, heavy saucepan.</li><BR>
            <li>Combine the half-and-half, cream, and sugar, then heat over medium until it reaches a simmer, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat, cover, and allow to steep for 30 minutes.</li><BR>
            <li>In a large stainless-steel bowl, beat the egg yolks. Slowly incorporate 1/2 cup of the hot half-and-half mixture while whisking, then gradually add the remainder. Transfer the mixture back into the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring continuously, until the custard becomes thick, which should take about 10 minutes. The custard needs to be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.</li><BR>
            <li>Filter the custard into a spacious stainless-steel bowl placed in an ice water bath and throw away the vanilla pod. Stir from time to time until the custard is completely cooled. Pour the custard into an ice cream maker in batches, following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Churn until the ice cream is firm but still not overly hard. Keep the ice cream in airtight containers in the freezer for up to three days.</li><BR>
