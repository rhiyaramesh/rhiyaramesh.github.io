            <H4 style="text-align: left;">How to Make</H4>
            <li>Peel 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes. Using a very sharp knife or mandoline, cut the potatoes crosswise into very thin, 1/8-inch-thick slices. Place in a large bowl and add enough very cold water to cover. Let the potatoes soak for 15 minutes.</li><BR>
            <li>Meanwhile, make a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat 6 cups of a standard muffin tin with unsalted butter. Grate 2 garlic cloves. Melt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Turn off the heat. Add the garlic, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, combine.</li><BR>
            <li>When the potatoes are done soaking, drain, pat them dry with a towel, and return to the bowl. The slices will feel firmer.</li><BR>
            <li>Transfer the butter mixture onto the potatoes. Working quickly with your hands, separate the potato slices and rub with butter mixture. Depending on how cold the potatoes are, the butter may solidify; just rub the butter into the potato slices and it will melt as it bakes.</li><BR>
            <li>Build the potato roses, arranging the potato slices in one muffin cup at a time. Working from the outside in and starting with the larger slices, press 5 slices against the sides of the well, shingling and bending them as needed. Repeat arranging and overlapping 5 more slices inside the first layer. Place 3 slices on a cutting board and roll them up together, then place in the center of the well. Repeat shingling and rolling 3 more slices, and place in the center of the well. Depending on what the rose looks like at this point, you add more or less slices.</li><BR>
            <li>Repeat until you have as many roses as you desire. If you have any smaller pieces that donâ€™t twist well, stack them up in a buttered muffin well to make mini pommes anna.</li><BR>
            <li>Bake until the edges of the potato roses are golden-brown and crispy, for 30 to 35 minutes. While the pan is still warm, run a small offset spatula around each rose to loosen and remove from the pan.</li><BR>
            <li>Your crispy delights are ready! Dig in!</li><BR>
