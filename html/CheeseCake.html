            <li>1 and ½ cups graham cracker crumbs (about 12 full sheet crackers)</li>
            <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <H2 style="text-align: center;">Cheesecake</H2>
            <li>32 ounces full-fat cream cheese, softened to room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup full fat sour cream, at room temperature. If you don’t have sour cream, you can use greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice (optional, but recommended)</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>

            <H3 style="text-align: left;">How to Make</H3>
            <H4 style="text-align: left;">Crust</H4>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350OF</li><BR>
            <li>If you are starting with full graham crackers, use a food processor to blender to grind them into crumbs</li><BR>
            <li>Pour the crumbs and mix it with sugar until combined</li><BR>
            <li>Mix the sugar and crumbs with the melted butter. Try to mash or break up any large chunks or lumps.</li><BR>
            <li>Pour into an ungreased 9 or 10 inch pan.</li><BR>
            <li>Pat the crumbs down into the bottom and partly up the sides to make a compact crust. Do not pat too hard otherwise the crust will be too hard. Pat it down till the mixture is no longer crumbly. You can use the bottom of a measuring cup to flatten it out more.</li><BR>
            <H4 style="text-align: left;">Filling</H4>
            <li>Use a handheld or stand mixer to beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy. This may take about two minutes.</li><BR>
            <li>Add the sour cream/greek yogurt, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat til fully combined</li><BR>
            <li>On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until blended. After the final egg is mixed into the batter, stop mixing.</li><BR>
            <li>To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over mixing the batter as best as you can. You will have close to 6 cups of batter.</li><BR>
            <H4 style="text-align: left;">Water Bath</H4>
            <li>Fill a kettle with water and boil it. As the water is heating up, wrap aluminum foil around the crust pan</li><BR>
            <li>Place the pan with the crust inside a larger pan</li><BR>
            <li>Pour the batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula of spoon to smooth it into an even layer</li><BR>
            <li>Carefully pour one inch of the boiled water into the larger pan, then place the large pan into the oven. (note: the pan with the water isn’t the same as the one with the actual cheesecake)</li><BR>
            <li>Place the smaller pan with the cheesecake carefully into the larger pan. Both pans should be in the oven</li><BR>
            <li>Bake the cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. If you notice the cheesecake browning too quickly on the top, cover it with a foil halfway through baking</li><BR>
            <li>When it's done, the center will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan</li><BR>
            <li>Turn the oven off and open the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven as it cools down fo an hour</li><BR>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours are overnight</li><BR>
            <li>Use a knife to cut the cheesecake into slices</li><BR>
            <li>Serve with the toppings of your choice. Enjoy!</li><BR>
